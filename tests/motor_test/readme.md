Make sure the wheels are free to turn. 
Load this sketch on the Arduino, power up the robot, connect the Arduino via USB and open the Arduino serial terminal. 
Enter the letter h and press ENTER. A help text should appear, telling you which commands are available. 

* Type ```e``` and hit ENTER to enable the motors.
* Type ```c 0 1``` and hit ENTER to command 1.0A of current to motor 0. 
* Type ```s``` and hit ENTER to stop the motor. 
Do the same for motor 1. 
You can try higher currents, too. 
Use the ```b``` command to command both motors at the same time.

If the system is working as expected, both motors should react very similiar to similar currents.
